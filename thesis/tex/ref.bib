abstract="Orthogonal drawings of graphs are widely investigated in the literature and many algorithms have been presented to compute such drawings. Most of these algorithms lead to unpleasant drawings with many bends and a large area. We present methods how to improve the quality of given orthogonal drawings. Our algorithms try to simulate the thinking of a human spectator in order to achieve good results. We also give instructions how to implement the strategies in a way that a good runtime performance can be achieved.",
